Chicago is among the first cities in the US to engage Service Designers to understand stakeholder needs and design access to integrated services accessible across in-person, physical, phone, and digital platforms.<br> 
This studio project is an opportunity to explore civic service design, designing new ways for residents to access and engage with services provided by the City of Chicago.<br>

		<h2>Design Topic</h2>
<p>
Understanding a Welcome Service for Residents should be accessible, inclusive, innovative and engaging, we are going to focus on designing to meet the needs of <span>[Civic technologists partnering with the city and the open data portal]</span>. </p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>
While cities are built around services for residents, businesses, and visitors, the practice of Civic Service Design is <span>in its earliest stages.</span> <br>

Understanding the opportunity space is critical since we believe that the best services are designed <span>for real people in specific contexts.</span><br>

As the project is moving forward, we need to continuously explore how the service we designed <span>sets the tone for what it means to engage as a citizen</span>.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Explore and design ways in which residents discover and engage with City services, ordinances, and opportunities delivered in an accessible, inclusive, and innovative manner.<br>

1. <span>Get Chicagoans the services they need</span>. -Improve access to services for all Chicagoans.<br>

2. <span>Engage residents with their city and community</span>.-Build and enrich communities that use services. <br><br>

#3 QR code in context<br></span>

</p>

				
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>
● Identify the most critical elements of the service experience<br>
● Develop user empathy through user interviews or first-hand experience<br>
● Present their ideas in a clear, articulate, client- and human-centric model<br>
● Provide potential design concepts that deliver on their determined critical elements<br>
● Prototype concepts to communicate and refine their ideas<br>
● Provide a technical rational for success<br>
● Explore current and near-term-future technologies that enable the idea

	<h2>Stakeholders Maps</h2>
	<p>Now the city of Chicago is providing data via the open data portal. People could search, download data they want. And the government could release the data after they received a request. </p>

	<p>Civic technologists are a group of people who are passionate for contributing their specialization into civic tech projects. They are using and processing data from the open data portal now.<br>

Some civic tech events are happening in the city weekly, like chi hack night and open uptown. Both of them have good participants base and various background people involved in, like the data scientists, developers, designers, and business people. <br>

Civic tech projects are developed based on Chicago citizens needs and trying to solve some specific problem like E. Coli, bike lane or focusing on some specific topics, like voting and election.<br>

<span>Insight 2: Tech internal revelry<br>Although various background people are developing various topic projects, it seems like only techs show up in Chi hack night, so there is a gap between the tech community with residents.</span></p>

	<h1>Research</h1>
	    	<h2> #3 Civic Technologists<br>individual interviews</h2>
<p>Methods<br>
Interception in civic tech events<br>
Phone call informative interview<br>
In person interview <br><br>

	<span>Insight 3: Sustainability dilemma<br>
	Aligned with many efforts in developments, technologists know that without people from related communities their product would go a wrong path, but it's hard for them to make the residents and communities involved in their project. </span></p>


	<h1>Research</h1>
	    	<h2> #4 Residents </h2>
	    	<p>
	    		<span>Insight 4: Isolated awareness<br>
	    		Although some residents eager to make an impact in their community, they don't know civic tech could help them solve problems. </span></p>
<h1>Research</h1>
	    	<h2> #5 Internal collaboration<br>with other teams</h2>
	    	<p>Three other teams focus on public service, immigrant family and disabled people. So we could find a matched community for reaching out potential motivated residents and unmet needs which could be solved by civic tech. <br>
	    		<span>Insight 5: Civic tech vacuum <br>
	    		Residents now even don't know that many civic tech groups are focusing on developing a product to solve their problems. </span></p>

make the civic tech project more sustainable?</h2>
<p><span>Problem Narrative</span><br>
Now from idea formation to launching, the real resident's involvement is too little. As the primary users in the future, without their feedback during product development, the product would fail after launching since it didn't catch the user's needs.</p>

<p><span>1. Motivate residents to join in Civic Tech Projects by the successful cases of Civic Tech in Chicago<br><br>
2. Make better projects and motivated residents matching: More matched, more engaged<br><br>
3. Show a precise measurement of their contribution in civic tech and engagement in their communities, so that they are driven by improvement and comparison<br><br>

				Build a partnership with existing civic technology events like Chi Hack Night or Open Uptown to understand the feasibility of Civic Connect Chicago<br><br>
<span>Outreach</span><br>
Some channels to reach residents that want to increase their civic engagement are high school computer science classes, community centers, and town hall or beat meetings, but more exploration on other locations or avenues can be done to increase outreach.
