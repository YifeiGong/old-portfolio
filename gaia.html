<p>
We solve this problem by providing detection and notification of the early onset of meltdowns. The product I’m designing is smart apparel to parents of children with autism that is concerned with their child’s well-being. Our solution provides a cost-effective, real-time stress detection and mitigation system with automated and hands-free biosensing technology to empower individuals with autism. <br><br></p>

<p><span>Reason 1: Hard to detect:<br></span>
	Triggers of Meltdown are various, so it’s hard and complicated to predict. <br><br>
These characteristics child with autism have make meltdown hard to manage and predict:<br>
(1) Lacking self-control and independence: Most autistics are dependent on their caregivers in daily life. They couldn’t actively address the difficulties in their life even if they’ve been aware of the problems.<br> 
(2) Hypersensitivity / Sensory Overload / Various sensitiveness: They have different levels of sensitiveness to different external factors like sound, material, and environment changes so that they couldn’t keep a peaceful mind. And those could be triggers of meltdown.<br>
(3) Communication difficulties: Most people with autism are nonverbal and not conversational if they don’t receive systematic training. They might only be able to repeat scripts in their mind taught by parents or teachers. So self-report and behavior justification could be not realistic for them.
<br>
Those are reasons why ASD communities are focusing on predicting a meltdown by technology.<br> <br> <br>

 <span>Reason 2: Negative influence (Emotional toll and physical harm):</span> <br>It would be bothersome or dangerous to child with autism, caregivers or other people when it happens in public.

Lacking of understanding of biometrics<br></span>

Caregivers only have access to information professional caregivers provide to them. Even if there are a bunch of products developed based on biomedical technology, they don't know those could help to understand the factors behind meltdown triggers. <br>
<br><br></p></div></div></div></div>


<div class="portfolio-details2">
<h2>2. Concerns we could eliminate<br><br> </h2><p>
<span>(1) Data and information privacy</span><br>
Some caregivers concern about the privacy of their children so they are unwilling to trust biomedical technology could help them. <br><br>
<span>(2) Untrustful stability</span><br>
In the common mind, now biotech is still in an experimental stage so they don’t want to experiment. <br><br>
<span>(3) The improvement couldn't be clear demonstrated.<br><br></span>
<span>(4) Everyone has a different standard of the condition</span><br>Like baseline or difference sensitiveness, so it’s hard to measure and manage by one model<br><br></p>
<h2>3. Potential Customers</h2><p>

<br><br><div class="portfolio-details2"><p>
<span>Summary</span><br>
When using technology to make product design, for typical consumers, making technology understandable is very important. And also for training or habits building product, showing a clear improvement is also a big part for caregivers to acknowledge their commitment.

<span>Smart shirt and apparel design consideration:<br></span>
1. Washability <br>
2. Softness<br>
3. Strechyness<br>
4. Wearability<br><br>

<span>Biomedical technology consideration:<br></span>
1. Mix and match solutions to customize for child’s needs<br>
2. Parents are likely to keep trying new technologies if they see improvements with their child<br>
3. Parents have some habits like writing journals for tracking changing or improvement<br>
4. Parents are willing to use a new product continuously if they got an improvement could be measured <br><br>


<span>Product accessibility consideration:<br></span>
Parent(s) are who cannot afford a caretaker, can afford our product<br><br>

<span>Emotional consideration:<br></span>
1. Meltdowns result in physical harm to child, parent(s), or caregivers<br>
2. Parent(s) are comfortable with using our product without concern<br>
3. Parents are more likely to try a new product if they have a better connection with other caregivers<br>
4. If the improvement is going back and forth, it would be frustrating for parents and caregivers. <br><br>
<div class="portfolio-details2"><p>
<span>Summary</span><br>
For the apparel design, the adaptbility is important since they have consideration of if the apparel is affordable or not in a long term, when they choosing wearbales.

<h1>White Space opportunities</h1>
			<h2>Identify differentiation opportunities? </h2>
			<p>
The product we are going to develop is a sensor embedded IoT compression shirt (smart apparel) with an associated mobile application to show emotional changes based on zones of regulation to provide early detection of the emotional state of an individual with autism in order to be proactive of meltdowns for the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) community.<br><br></p>
<h2>Focused differentiation points:<br></h2>
<p>
<span>1. Meltdown Management<br>Matching sensitivity with occuring of meltdown<br></span>
Hypersensitivity is a common trait of those with autism; the individuals are prone to fits of rage or angst when triggers occur. The most common method to combat this utilizes a weighted vest, typically used in conjunction with an assistant aid; the idea is to put pressure on the individual to make them feel grounded, mimicking a hug. The issues lie in a heavy-weight of the vest, unsightly appearance, and inconvenience. <br><br>
 
<span>2. Meltdown Prediction<br>Clear demonstration by using the Zones of Regulation<br></span>
<img src="img/gaia/images/D1.png" width="100%"><br><br>
There is a common understanding that If we are able to recognize when we are becoming less regulated, we are able to do something about it to manage our feelings and get ourselves to a healthy place. This comes naturally for some, but for others(people with autism) it is a skill that needs to be taught and practiced. This is the goal of The Zones of Regulation (or Zones for short).<br> ​<br>

The Zones is a systematic, cognitive behavioral approach used to teach self-regulation by categorizing all the different ways we feel and states of alertness we experience into four concrete colored zones.  The Zones framework provides strategies to teach students to become more aware of and independent in controlling their emotions and impulses, manage their sensory needs, and improve their ability to problem solve conflicts. 

The color could be more direct and clear to show their current status without more learning cost.</p></div> <br><br>

<div class="portfolio-details2"><p>
<span>Summary</span><br>
There is no current solution focusing on matching factors caused a meltdown with a child with autism's sensitivity. If parents could manage meltdown causes, it would be helpful to reduce the exposure from dangerous elements and predict or prevent a meltdown.
