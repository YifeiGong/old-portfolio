<h5>User Research, User Experience Design, Microsoft Internship</h5>
		<p>
		
		<span>DURATION</span> June 2019 - Sept. 2019 (12 Weeks)<br>
	    <span>MENTOR</span> Yan Yan (Senior UX Designer)<br>
	    <span>TOOLS</span> Paper & Pen, Sketch, Principle<br>
		</p>
			        	<h3>My Role</h3>
			        	<p>I was <span>a UX Design intern at Microsoft</span> last summer, worked on <span>product design of Bing.com News Vertical.</span><br><br>

			        		1. Researched and characterized Google News, Microsoft News, AP News, Reuters, Yahoo News Mobile App and conducted competitor studies focused on news browsing related features<br>
			        		2. Explored Mobile-end news browsing behaviors and habits and explored various interactions<br>
			        		3. Created high-fi solutions for end to end content personalization flow and features on mobile<br>
			        	4. Involved in Bing.com weekly product review meeting</h3>

			        	<h5>Problem</h5>
			        	<p>For my <span>focus</span> project, the problem I explored was:</p> <br>
			        	<h3>How Might We<br> 
			        	Design a mobile-end content personalization experience for people who browse news on Bing?</h3>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

		<p>Here are screens I delivered for my focus project. My project outcomes are under NDA and could be released publicly after implementation next year.</p>
		<img src="img/bing/images/A3.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>
	
       <p>If you are interested in this project as a potential employer, <span>feel free to reach out me at yifeigong2020@u.northwestern.edu</span> to schedule a presentation. </p>

	<h2>Process</h2>



<img src="img/bing/images/A2.jpg" width="100%">
<p>
Bing News is a news aggregator powered by artificial intelligenceâ€“is a part of <span>Microsoft's Bing search engine</span>,which processes billions of global searches. </p>
<img src="img/bing/images/A1.jpg" width="100%">
<p>


Operating in the United States and other international markets, Bing News displays the latest news stories on Bing.com/News on desktop and mobile, the Bing Search app(Opal), and through enterprise streams such as the Outlook News Connector, PowerBI and Bing for business. <br><br>

		My initial goal of this internship was to learn how to do product design in a global company which was redifined as visioning and visualizing key user experiences and use cases for <span>Bing.com News Vertical Mobile FY 2020 products</span>.

	    I explored some design methods I never used before.</p>
		<img src="img/bing/images/A4.jpg" width="100%">
	
		
			<p>I regularly made <span>whitleboarding sessions</span> to present my exploration and results, like learning Bing News Vertical, Competitors Study, Design Exploration. I used <span>paper prototyping</span> to validate design independently. At my last day, I framed my works to one storyline with hi-fi designs and presented to my team collegues, managers and seniors from other teams. 
		<br><br>

I identified some unique value of Bing.com mobile end experience, defined <span>Content Personalization cross-platforms user journey and functions</span>, and designed features and interactions. </p>

			<h2>Side Project</h2>
			<h3>Coding for News</h3>
			   <img src="img/bing/images/A8.jpg" width="100%">
			   <p>I improved the productivity of news and content-related product design by design tools, data, and coding.<br><br>
				<span>The Problem<br></span>
				When making a design showcase, because of the inherence of News, it requires to refill the content with the latest news. But this process takes a lot of effort from designers, wasted their time and affected their passion for designing various solutions.
				<br><br>
				<span>Workarounds<br></span>
				I tried some solutions like some sketch plugins and content generators, but none of them could help this problem.
				<br><br>
				At that point, I was learning front-end coding by the React framework. It inspires me that coding might be able to make this process more efficient.<br><br>

				<span>Solution<br></span>
				Step 1: Export design redlines or React front-end file from Sketch<br><br>

Step 2: Get news title, snippets, and images by python or SQL from the database<br><br>

Step 3: Organize app.js and corresponding css documents<br><br>
Step 4: Import data and run code<br><br>

Step 5: Re-check the performance of React coding with the origin Sketch file<br><br>

So that every time after finalizing the design, designers could fill the design showcase by getting and changing the data with the latest news without back and forth from different software and webpage. 
<br><br>
I'm wrapping up my code and will publish them on github.

			<h2>Key Learnings</h2>
			<p>
			<span>1. Design Alignment For Cross-platform Product</span><br>
			When a product has multiple ends on multiple devices, it's harder to determine a function in the different use cases and scenarios. Sometimes, we should wait for a feature aligning to all ends. Sometimes we should focus on one end and only iterate it till the new feature become mature. It reminds me to keep in mind that this function will be aligned to other ends when designing a new function. Thus, this new function shouldn't be only based on user behaviors of mobile devices. It's better to make it with better compatibility. 
<br><br>
			<span>2. Interaction For Mobile Native And Mobile Web</span><br>
            Different end experience has different visual and interaction guideline. Even if for the mobile experience, I should consider the difference and familiarity between the native mobile app and mobile web in the browser. That requires me to balance the design pattern and user flow on each end. For example, it's better having less page jumping for mobile web browsing. So I chose to design the same feature with two shift tabs other than nesting pages on the native mobile app. 
<br><br>
			<span>3. Balance Benefits And Efforts Designs Could Bring</span><br>
			As a design novice, it's easy to get into the excitement that there are a lot of design opportunities, so designing a lot of new features to fulfill those gaps. Actually, here is an important point should be thought a lot is what is the value your design could bring to user comparing with the current design. If it's going only to add on learning cost, that's definitely not the right design we should implement now. Be ready to provide designs in a range, know the pros and cons of each and answer the why behind them.

      <p>The most challenge part of this project was the technical solution part. To get a better output, I chose a solution which could not be programmed by myself. But with the help of an engineer, we finally got a good actualization and tested it successfully.<br><br>

I applied for a patent after graduation. Moreover, based on the wire in the smart material and solar energy system, the volume of lurie system could be reduced dramatically. Thus it could be more convenient to assemble on the clothes and cheap for the users.
